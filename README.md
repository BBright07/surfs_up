Overview of the statistical analysis:
    This analysis utilized SQLite database, Jupyter notebook, and VS Code to analyze weather data trends in Oahu, HI to build a business that will be impacted positively or negatively by weather during major vacation periods in the summer (June) and winter (December).

Overview of the statistical analysis:
    -The average temperature is higher in June (74.9 degrees) than December (71.0 degrees)
    -December is colder, with a minimum temperature of 56 degrees compared to 64 degrees in June
    -The highest temperatures are in June at 85 degrees, while the maximum temperature in December is 2 degrees lower
Summary:
    -Overall the weather in December is milder, while June is hotter. The two graphs produced for each month highlight the frequency of temperatures. December is closer to a normal distribution with the average of around 71 degrees also being the most frequent temperature. As for June, the temperature is more unstable with many days falling around 75 degrees and 78 degrees. These temperature changes have a significant impact on oceans and wave intensity that can improve surfing activity or make it too dangerous. However, higher temperatures also mean an increase in precipitation which can negatively impact the business compared to a more temperate climate in the winter.
